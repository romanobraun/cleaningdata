# cleaningdata

This script will fuse the train and test dataset including the specimen numbers and tests performed. Then, I will add the column names defined in the dataset to the fused file and save it as dataset.csv.
Finally, all mean and sd columns will be fused to a new dataset and the mean values per user and test performed will be calculated for each variable. The tidy dataset will be saved as tidy.csv.

--- Instructions ---
1) Place run_analysis.R in the folder of the dataset containing the subfolders test and train.
2) Define the folder as working directory within the .R script.
3) Run the script
