# cleaningdata

This script will fuse the train and test dataset including the specimen numbers and tests performed. Then, I will add the column names defined in the dataset to the fused file and save it as dataset.csv.
Finally, all mean and sd columns will be fused to a new dataset and the mean values per user and test performed will be calculated for each variable. The tidy dataset will be saved as tidy.csv.

--- Instructions ---
1) Place run_analysis.R in the folder of the dataset containing the subfolders test and train.
2) Define the folder as working directory within the .R script.
3) Run the script

Dataset could not be included in the repository due to file size limtations but can be obtained here:

Tidy dataset "tidy.csv" is included in the repository.

Code until every human is well!
